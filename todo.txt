last activity: developmenty of export_packing which is not ready...

problems:
how to determine sampling 1 and 2 from a list of data
facts:
job nr is the name of the operator
always 2x50 sticks taken for measuring abc defects (these are divided in sample nr 1 and 2)
both samples are not taken at the same time but originate from the same operator

again discussion about the job number and determination that is currently split
alex says the determination should not be split, however during the last meeting it was decided
to split it together with the jobnr (operator)

there should be another meeting to make those things clear
